# NodeServer

This is a Node.js application.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd NodeServer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Building the Application

To build and run the application, follow these steps:

1. If your application requires a build step (for example, if you use TypeScript or a bundler), run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. To start the application, run:
   ```bash
   cd ./build/
   node index.js
   ```

This will build (if necessary) and launch your Node.js server.
